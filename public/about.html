<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I am a current first year Computer Science undergraduate student at Concordia University who is extraordinarily excited to 
  jump into this new chapter of my life</p>

<p>I ma interested in diving into fields of Computer Science such as web development, game development, system designs, 
  and algorithms. I am also interested in subjects such as cryptography and cybersecurity</p>

<p>In my free time, I love heavy weight lifting, martial arts, and sharpening my skills as programming through projects 
  such as this one.</p>
